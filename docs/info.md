## How it works

A 4-bit up/down counter controlled by two input bits. When `ui_in[0]` (up) is high, the counter increments each clock cycle. When `ui_in[1]` (down) is high, it decrements. When both are high, the counter holds its value. The count wraps around — overflowing from 15 back to 0 and underflowing from 0 back to 15. The current count is output on the lower 4 bits of `uo_out`

## How to test
1. Reset the counter by pulling `rst_n` low for at least 2 clock cycles, then release it high.
2. Set `ui_in[0] = 1, ui_in[1] = 0` to count up — the count on `uo_out[3:0]` should increment each clock cycle.
3. Set `ui_in[0] = 0, ui_in[1] = 1` to count down.
4. Set both `ui_in[0] = 1, ui_in[1] = 1` to hold the current value.
5. Verify overflow by counting up past 15 —> it should wrap to 0.
6. Verify underflow by counting down past 0 —> it should wrap to 15.

## Descirption of AI 
I used AI to help me understand the timing in my testbench because I always confused the way cocotb uses the clockcyle waiting time. Other than that all files were written by me
